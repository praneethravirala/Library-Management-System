# Library Management System

## Project Overview  
The **Library Management System** is a database-driven solution designed to enhance the operational efficiency of public and private libraries. This system automates book cataloging, borrowing, returning, and managing member and staff records. By providing structured data organization and query optimization, it streamlines processes to improve user experience and library management.

## Features  
- **Material Cataloging:** Manages books, magazines, e-books, and audiobooks with metadata like title, genre, and publication date.
- **Member & Staff Management:** Maintains records of library members and staff, including contact information, roles, and membership details.  
- **Borrowing & Returning System:** Tracks material checkouts, due dates, and late returns.  
- **Authorship & Genre Classification:** Associates books with authors and categorizes materials into genres.  
- **Query Optimization:** Implements SQL queries for advanced searching, administrative reports, and overdue notifications.

## Database Structure  
The system follows an **ER Model** with well-defined relationships. Key entities include:  
- **Material (Books, Magazines, etc.)**  
- **Borrowing System**  
- **Member & Staff Records**  
- **Catalog & Genre Classification**  
- **Authorship & Author Records**  

Each entity has structured relationships to ensure data consistency and efficient management.
